\section*{Abstract}
Musculoskeletal simulations are used in many different applications, ranging from the design of wearable robots that interact with humans to the analysis of patients with impaired movement. Here, we introduce OpenSim Moco, a software toolkit for optimizing the motion and control of musculoskeletal models built in the OpenSim modeling and simulation package. OpenSim Moco uses the direct collocation method, which is often faster and can handle more diverse problems than other methods for musculoskeletal simulation. Moco frees researchers from implementing direct collocation themselves---which typically requires extensive technical expertise---and allows them to focus on their scientific questions. The software can handle a wide range of problems that interest biomechanists, including motion tracking, motion prediction, parameter optimization, model fitting, electromyography-driven simulation, and device design. Moco is the first musculoskeletal direct collocation tool to handle kinematic constraints, which \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are common in musculoskeletal models. To show Moco's abilities }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{enable modeling of kinematic loops (e.g., cycling models) and complex anatomy (e.g., patellar motion). To show the abilities of Moco}\DIFaddend , we first solved for muscle activity that produced an observed walking motion while minimizing \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{squared }\DIFaddend muscle excitations and knee joint loading. Next, we predicted how muscle weakness may cause deviations from a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{healthy }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normal }\DIFaddend walking motion. Lastly, we predicted a squat-to-stand motion and optimized the stiffness of an assistive device placed at the knee. We designed Moco to be easy to use, customizable, and extensible, thereby accelerating the use of simulations to understand \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{human and animal movement }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the movement of humans and other animals}\DIFaddend .

\section*{Introduction}

Musculoskeletal simulations have shed light on movement disorders by, for example, discovering ways to walk that reduce knee loading~\cite{Fregly:2007ac}, revealing that children with cerebral palsy exhibit simplified motor control when walking~\cite{Steele:2015}, and reproducing eye disorders that cause \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{double vision}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{diplopia}\DIFaddend ~\cite{Priamikov:2016}. Beyond human health and performance, researchers use musculoskeletal simulations to understand how \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{nonhuman }\DIFaddend animals move, for example by studying dinosaur locomotion~\cite{sthaya:2005uk} and differences between human and chimpanzee strength~\cite{ONeill:2017}.

Simulations of movement are often categorized by whether the motion is prescribed from experimental data or predicted by the simulation. One may prescribe the motion of a musculoskeletal model to match a motion measured in an experiment~\cite{Thelen:2003bba,Lloyd:2003} to estimate unmeasured quantities such as muscle-level energy consumption~\cite{Farris:2014du,Jackson:2017go}. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Existing }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The most commonly used }\DIFaddend prescribed motion methods are rapid but \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are not customizable (e.g., cost functions are predefined) or }\DIFdelend lack support for important model features such as muscle dynamics \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(e.g., static optimization~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Prilutsky:2002}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
).
}\DIFaddend Motion prediction~\cite{Geijtenbeek:2019} can establish cause-effect relationships (e.g., discovering gait impairments that arise from weakness or contracture~\cite{Ong:2019}) and help design clinical interventions (e.g., prostheses~\cite{Handford:2016kd}).
However, methods for predicting motions\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, such as single shooting,  }\DIFaddend often require waiting many hours or days for a solution, so researchers often simplify the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{model's musculature }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{musculature of their model }\DIFaddend or reduce the dimensionality of the control scheme\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Anderson:2001gv,Ong:2019}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend .
A third category, which lies between prescribing and predicting motion, is tracking motion, where errors between model kinematics and reference data are part of the cost function rather than exactly prescribed~\cite{Lin:2017jp}.
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{To }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{While some researchers have created their own code to solve problems spanning the prescribed-to-predicted spectrum, many researchers lack the expertise or resources required to implement custom algorithms.
Simulation methods that solve diverse problems, combined with tools that make these methods easy to adopt for all researchers, would }\DIFaddend accelerate the application of simulations to scientific and clinical questions\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, researchers need unified simulation tools for solving diverse problems that span the prescribed-to-predicted spectrum and involve a variety of costs and unknown model parameters}\DIFdelend .

Most musculoskeletal simulations are naturally posed as optimal control problems~\cite{Todorov:2003}. Optimal control problems seek \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a system's }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend parameters and time-varying controls \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of a system }\DIFaddend that minimize a cost (e.g., energy consumption) subject to the system \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend dynamics, expressed as differential-algebraic equations. An increasingly popular method for solving optimal control problems is to approximate the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{system's }\DIFdelend states and controls \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of the system }\DIFaddend as polynomial splines \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{over a mesh of time points and then }\DIFaddend solve for the knot points that lead the spline to obey the system \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend dynamics~\cite{Betts:2010, Kelly:2017}. The dynamics are enforced by requiring the time derivative of the state splines to match the derivative from the system \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend differential equations at specified time points. This method is called ``direct collocation'' because the spline derivatives are ``collocated'' with the exact derivatives (\cite{Hairer:1993}, page 211;~\cite{Hairer:1996}, page 498). Direct collocation produces a nonlinear program in which the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{system }\DIFdelend states are introduced as variables and the system \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend dynamics are enforced as constraints. Typical musculoskeletal models lead to optimization problems with thousands of variables. These large problems are tractable with direct collocation because the constraints enforcing the system \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{'s }\DIFdelend dynamics at a given time depend only on the variables near that time.

The advantages of direct collocation have led biomechanists to use the method for prescribing motions~\cite{Groote:2016dq,Ueno:2020}, tracking motions~\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

}\DIFaddend , fitting muscle properties~\cite{Falisse:2017}, and optimizing model parameters~\cite{Rohani:2017}. Researchers have made key methodological advances, including efficiently handling multibody and muscle dynamics via implicit formulations~\cite{vandenBogert:2011fv,Groote:2016dq}, minimizing energy consumption~\cite{Koelewijn:2018kw,Koelewijn:2019}, and employing algorithmic differentiation to simulate complex models more rapidly compared to using finite differences~\cite{Falisse:2019a}.

Despite \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{direct collocation's advantages}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the advantages of direct collocation}\DIFaddend , very few biomechanics laboratories have been able to apply this powerful technique. The method requires arduous bookkeeping of variables and efficient calculation of the objective and constraint function derivatives required by gradient-based optimization algorithms. Several direct collocation solvers exist (e.g.,~\cite{Becerra:2010,Patterson:2014}), but current solvers require users to incorporate their musculoskeletal models manually. OpenSim is a software package used by thousands of biomechanics researchers to model musculoskeletal systems~\cite{Delp:2007ij,Seth:2018gg,Sherman:2011byc}, but OpenSim does not currently employ direct collocation. Several biomechanists have graciously shared their code combining OpenSim or hand-coded models with direct collocation solvers, but such code is tailored to specific models or \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{motions, handles only unconstrained models , or contains }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{problem formulations, or lacks support for models with kinematic constraints ~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Groote:2016dq,Porsa:2015dn,Lee:2016dn,Lin:2018ex}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
. Furthermore, such code can depend on }\DIFaddend closed-source components\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, which can limit custom extensions~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Groote:2016dq}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . Lastly, choosing the problem formulation (e.g., expressing dynamics as explicit or implicit differential equations) and solver settings (e.g., detecting sparsity patterns automatically) that lead to fast convergence requires expertise; ideally, such expertise is embedded into the software via defaults, and users can edit their formulation or solver settings with simple commands.

To improve the accessibility of advanced optimal control methods in musculoskeletal biomechanics, we introduce OpenSim Moco (``musculoskeletal optimal control''), an easy-to-use, customizable, and extensible software toolkit for solving optimal control problems with OpenSim musculoskeletal models (Fig~\ref{overviewmoco}). OpenSim frees biomechanists from implementing equations of motion on their own, and Moco frees biomechanists from implementing direct collocation. Moco not only removes the need to set up gradient-based optimization, but also provides an interface that abstracts away the details of constructing an optimal control problem. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{With just a few lines of code, researchers can solve complex problems with an OpenSim model for almost any movement. }\DIFdelend Users can add custom cost terms or constraints if Moco does not provide what they need. This paper details \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Moco's }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the }\DIFaddend design and implementation \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of Moco }\DIFaddend and shows three applications. First, we estimated muscle activity for an observed walking motion and predicted changes in muscle activity with a different cost function. Second, we used Moco to predict how muscle weakness may cause deviations from a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{healthy }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normal }\DIFaddend walking motion. Finally, to illustrate that Moco can predict motions and model parameters, we predicted a squat-to-stand motion and optimized the stiffness of a passive assistive device.

\section*{Design and implementation}

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Moco solves }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Researchers can use Moco to solve }\DIFaddend optimal control problems that \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{users define using }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{they define via }\DIFaddend a library of cost and constraint modules, which are implemented through configurable software classes. Users describe their problem with the \textit{MocoProblem} class. (We \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{denote }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{use italics to denote the }\DIFaddend names of classes in Moco and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Moco's dependencies with italics}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{OpenSim}\DIFaddend .) To decouple the problem from the numerical methods used to solve it, we use the \textit{MocoSolver} class. Moco classes are available via C++, MATLAB, Python, and XML text files, with interfaces familiar to OpenSim users. We package the \textit{MocoProblem} and \textit{MocoSolver} together into a \textit{MocoStudy} (Fig~\ref{mocodiagram}), which can be written to and loaded from XML text files. Moco contains utilities for visualizing and plotting \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a study's solution}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the solution to a study}\DIFaddend , which is held by the \textit{MocoSolution} class. For certain standard biomechanics problems, Moco provides simpler interfaces that may be preferable to the flexibility of \textit{MocoStudy}.

\subsection*{Defining problems with \textit{MocoProblem}}

\textit{MocoProblem} supports a diversity of scientific questions and contains the following elements.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{cost terms}: Users can minimize a weighted sum of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{control effort}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{squared controls}\DIFaddend , deviation from an observed motion, joint reaction loads, the duration of a motion, and other costs by appending to the \textit{MocoProblem} an instance of the class associated with a cost module (e.g., \textit{MocoControlGoal} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{implements the control effort cost}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{allows minimizing the sum of squared controls}\DIFaddend ).
\item \textbf{multibody dynamics, muscle dynamics, and kinematic constraints}:\DIFaddbegin \\\DIFaddend OpenSim \textit{Models} are a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{standard way to describe musculoskeletal systems, and }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{popular format for modeling musculoskeletal systems. }\DIFaddend Moco uses OpenSim \textit{Models} to obtain the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{system's }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{underlying differential-algebraic system of equations, including }\DIFaddend multibody dynamics, auxiliary dynamics (e.g., muscle activation dynamics and tendon compliance), and kinematic constraints\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. Moco handles kinematic constraints (}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{; these equations are provided by the industrial-grade Simbody multibody dynamics library~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Sherman:2011byc}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
. Moco supports any kinematic constraints present in the system }\DIFaddend using a method by Posa and colleagues~\cite{Posa:2016}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{), which are commonly used to model anatomy such as }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. Kinematic constraints are useful for modeling anatomy that either is not easily described using standard joints or would otherwise require calibrated models of ligaments and cartilage to produce the salient features of the desired motion. Examples of models with complex anatomy achieved by kinematic constraints include models of }\DIFaddend the knee, shoulder, and neck~\cite{Seth:2016,Lerner:2015,Rajagopal:2016ek,Cazzola:2017}. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Kinematic constraints are also necessary when modeling closed kinematic loops. For example, cycling models can create closed kinematic loops if both feet are fixed to the same bicycle crank~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Jansen:2020}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
.
}\DIFaddend \item \textbf{boundary constraints}: Users can enforce average speed, symmetry, or periodicity with constraints relating initial and final states.
\item \textbf{path constraints}: Users can constrain any function of time to lie in a specified range over the motion. For example, researchers often estimate muscle activity with electromyography and Moco allows constraining simulated muscle excitations to be close to those measurements via the \textit{MocoControlBoundConstraint} class.
\item \textbf{parameter optimization}: Users can optimize model properties, such as \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{a body's mass, a muscle's }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the mass of a body, the }\DIFaddend optimal fiber length \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, or an exoskeleton's stiffness}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{of a muscle, or the stiffness of an exoskeleton}\DIFaddend .
\item \textbf{bounds on variables}: Users can bound the values of states, controls, and initial and final time.
\end{itemize}
For a detailed mathematical description of the problems supported by Moco, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{including how Moco handles kinematic constraints, }\DIFaddend consult S1 Appendix.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Users can combine the }\DIFaddend modules of a \textit{MocoProblem} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{can be combined }\DIFdelend in diverse ways. The following examples illustrate the breadth of problems that users can solve.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{dynamically-constrained inverse kinematics}: Minimize the error between experimental and model marker positions (marker tracking) and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{control effort }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{squared controls }\DIFaddend while obeying multibody dynamics.
\item \textbf{electromyography-constrained muscle force estimation}: For a prescribed experimental motion, minimize \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{squared }\DIFaddend muscle excitations while obeying multibody dynamics and constraining the difference between muscle excitations and electromyography data.
\item \textbf{torso mass calibration}: For a prescribed experimental motion, \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{adjust the mass of the torso to }\DIFaddend minimize residual forces at the pelvis while obeying multibody dynamics.
\item \textbf{prediction of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{muscle }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{kinematic and muscular }\DIFaddend coordination adaptations to \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{walking in }\DIFaddend an exoskeleton}: Minimize squared muscle excitations \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and the error between experimental joint angles and model coordinate values (state tracking) }\DIFdelend while obeying multibody and muscle dynamics \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and a constraint on average speed of the mass center}\DIFaddend .
\end{itemize}

We demonstrate \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Moco's }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the Moco }\DIFaddend interface in Fig~\ref{mocoexamplecode} with a simple MATLAB example. Setting the model and adding a cost (termed ``goal'' in the code) each require only a single statement.

\end{figure}

Direct collocation relies on gradient-based optimization, which converges faster and more reliably when all functions in the problem are continuous and differentiable. Moco includes a \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{previously published }\DIFaddend continuous and differentiable muscle model \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{named }\DIFaddend \textit{DeGrooteFregly2016Muscle}~\cite{Groote:2016dq}. We extended this muscle model to include damping, which further improves convergence but can introduce small compressive forces when the muscle fiber shortens at low activation. To represent compliant contact forces in a continuous and smooth manner, Moco \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{provides }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{includes a previously published contact model named }\DIFaddend \textit{SmoothSphereHalfSpaceForce}~\cite{Serrancoli:2019aa}.

Users wishing to employ a cost term, boundary constraint, or path constraint that Moco does not \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{support }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{provide }\DIFaddend can create a C++ plugin using the same steps as for OpenSim plugins. By providing a library of cost, boundary constraint, and path constraint modules, allowing these modules to be combined, and enabling users to create their own modules, we achieve our design goals of ease-of-use, customizability, and extensibility.

\subsection*{Solving problems with \textit{MocoSolver}}

All details of solving an optimal control problem are encapsulated in \textit{MocoSolver}, which is decoupled from \textit{MocoProblem} for flexibility. For example, users can add bodies or muscles to their model without modifying the solver. \textit{MocoSolver} uses the CasADi library~\cite{Andersson:2019} to transcribe the continuous optimal control problem defined by \textit{MocoProblem} into a finite-dimensional nonlinear program, which we solve with well-established gradient-based nonlinear program solvers such as IPOPT~\cite{Wachter:2006} and SNOPT~\cite{Gill:2005} (see S1 Appendix). \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{CasADi can provide the derivatives of the objective and constraint functions using either finite differences or algorithmic differentiation; Moco uses only finite differences to avoid the complexity of adapting the OpenSim codebase to support algorithmic differentiation.
}\DIFaddend 

Moco provides two transcription schemes: the second-order trapezoidal scheme and the third-order \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Hermite-Simpson }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Hermite--Simpson }\DIFaddend scheme~\cite{Betts:2010}. Multibody dynamics can be expressed with either explicit differential equations (``forward dynamics'') or implicit differential equations (``inverse dynamics''); problems may converge faster with implicit differential equations~\cite{vandenBogert:2011fv,Groote:2016dq}. \DIFaddbegin \textit{\DIFadd{MocoSolver}} \DIFadd{also provides settings for the constraint tolerance, convergence tolerance, and the number of mesh intervals used to solve the }\textit{\DIFadd{MocoProblem}}\DIFadd{.
}\DIFaddend 

Solving a \textit{MocoStudy} yields a \textit{MocoSolution} (Fig~\ref{mocosolverdiagram}), which is a subclass of \textit{MocoTrajectory} and provides easy access to the values of all variables at any iteration in the optimization. Users provide initial guesses via \textit{MocoTrajectory}, and can use the solution from one problem as the initial guess for a subsequent problem; this \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{permits }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{allows }\DIFaddend users to build a complex study with a series of simpler studies. For example, predicting the change in walking kinematics caused by an ankle exoskeleton could benefit from an initial guess generated from a tracking simulation of normal walking. \textit{MocoSolution} provides additional information, including whether or not the solver converged, the final objective value, and the number of solver iterations.

Users can use the solution of one problem as the initial guess for a subsequent problem.}

\end{figure}

After solving a problem, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Moco can }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{researchers can use Moco to }\DIFaddend visualize the solution as an animation, plot the state and control trajectories \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(with utilities provided in MATLAB and Python)}\DIFaddend , or compute quantities from the solution. The ability to save \textit{MocoTrajectories} and \textit{MocoStudies} to files allows users to reproduce each other's results, which is essential for sound science~\cite{Peng:2011}.

\subsection*{Tools for standard problems}

Currently, Moco provides two tools for solving standard problems (Fig~\ref{mocotooldiagram}):
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{MocoInverse} solves the muscle/actuator redundancy problem, wherein we solve for muscle (or other actuator) controls that achieve a motion that is prescribed exactly (see S1 Appendix) while minimizing \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{effort }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{squared controls }\DIFaddend or other costs.
\item \textit{MocoTrack} solves motion tracking problems, wherein we solve for both a motion and muscle (or other actuator) controls that minimize the error compared to an observed motion in addition to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{effort }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{squared controls }\DIFaddend or other costs.
\end{itemize}
\textit{MocoTrack} is useful for predicting deviations from motion data (e.g., predicting kinematic adaptations to an exoskeleton), while \textit{MocoInverse} is a faster option when the motion should be enforced exactly (e.g., estimating elastic energy storage for an observed motion). \textit{MocoTrack} can use contact models, while \textit{MocoInverse} can apply measured external forces to the model. For both tools, the only required inputs are an OpenSim model and motion data (coordinate or marker trajectories, and external forces \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{if relevant}\DIFaddend ). Internally, the tools build a \textit{MocoStudy} with solver settings that yield fast and reliable convergence on problems we tested.

    \caption{{\bf Solving prescribed motion, tracked motion, and predicted motion problems.}
        Moco provides the tools \textit{MocoTrack} and \textit{MocoInverse} for solving standard problems. Both require a \textit{Model} and kinematic data as inputs and produce controls and actuator states as outputs, but these tools solve different optimal control problems. \textit{MocoTrack} produces a new simulated motion, while \textit{MocoInverse} does not permit deviations from the provided kinematic data. Predicting a motion is not easily standardized and requires a custom \textit{MocoStudy}.
    }
    \label{mocotooldiagram}
    %\end{adjustwidth}
\end{figure}

Future versions of Moco may include tools for model calibration, electromyography-driven simulation, and other standard problems. For problems that do not fit into a standard form, such as predicting a motion, \textit{MocoStudy} provides the necessary flexibility.


\subsection*{Verification}

Verifying software is essential~\cite{Hicks:2015bo}; thus, we conducted extensive verification tests. For example, to verify that Moco implements direct collocation correctly we solved the ``linear tangent steering'' optimal control problem~\cite{Bryson:1975}, which has a known solution. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Moco's }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The }\DIFaddend solution matched the known solution with a root-mean-square error of $2.7 \times 10^{-5}$.

We also ensured that a time-stepping forward simulation using controls from a motion prediction produced the same motion as in the prediction. This test used a model consisting of a point mass suspended by three muscles (\textit{DeGrooteFregly2016Muscle}) and under the influence of gravity (Fig~\ref{verification}). For this problem, the muscles had activation dynamics and rigid tendons. We first predicted the state and control trajectories to move the point mass between prescribed initial and final positions, starting and ending at rest (Fig~\ref{verification}, gray band). In this prediction, the cost included both the sum of squared muscle excitations and the final time. Then, we used the predicted controls to perform a time-stepping forward simulation using an OpenSim integrator (Fig~\ref{verification}, blue line). The resulting position trajectory of the point mass matched that from the prediction with a root-mean-square error of 0.0051 m (1.8\% of the distance between the initial and final positions). This gives us confidence that Moco enforces the same multibody and muscle dynamics enforced in a time-stepping forward simulation in OpenSim. For more complex problems, conducting a time-stepping forward simulation using controls from a \textit{MocoSolution} requires a stabilizing feedback controller to counteract numerical errors.

        \label{verification}
%    \end{adjustwidth}
\end{figure}

To gain confidence in motion tracking problems, we ensured that using \textit{MocoTrack} on a synthesized motion with known muscle activity produced the original muscle activity. We used the same suspended point mass model and tracked the previous motion prediction (Fig\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{6}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~\ref{verification}}\DIFaddend , gray band) while minimizing squared excitations. The muscle activations from \textit{MocoTrack} (Fig\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{6}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~\ref{verification}}\DIFaddend , orange line) matched those from the prediction with a root-mean-square error that was 0.47\% of the peak predicted activation. For most tracking problems of interest, we do not know the true muscle activity solution; verifying tracking problems using synthesized data gives us confidence in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Moco’s estimates of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the ability of Moco to estimate }\DIFaddend muscle activity.

Moco contains an automated test suite\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{with over 30 files }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, with over 80 test cases, }\DIFaddend that extends beyond the verification described here. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{For example, the test suite ensures that users receive error messages for incorrect input, that a }\textit{\DIFdel{MocoStudy}} %DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{can be written to and read from an XML file, that kinematic constraints are enforced, and that implicit and explicit differential equations are consistent. We ensure all these }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The test suite contains four major types of tests: analytical tests, interface tests, algorithmic tests, and regression tests.

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Our automated test suite can give users confidence that Moco implements direct collocation correctly, but users must ensure that they use appropriate mesh density (number of mesh intervals per unit time) and constraint tolerance settings for their problems~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

. While a problem with a coarse mesh may meet the user's specified constraint tolerance, errors in the dynamics may be too large for the simulation to be useful~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

. Users can perform convergence analyses to ensure that solutions are not overly sensitive to the chosen mesh density or constraint tolerance.

\DIFaddend \section*{Results}

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Here we present three results obtained using Moco that represent biomechanics applications spanning the prescribed-to-predicted spectrum. In the first result, we used the }\textit{\DIFadd{MocoInverse}} \DIFadd{tool to solve for muscle activity while prescribing exactly the model generalized coordinate values. We compared muscle activity results using cost functions with and without a knee contact loading term. In the second result, we used }\textit{\DIFadd{MocoTrack}} \DIFadd{to simulate normal walking and walking with weakened hip abductor and ankle dorsiflexor muscles. When simulating weakness, we weakened muscles (while retaining the original cost function weights) until the model was no longer able to track the normal kinematic reference data and compared the resulting motion to known gait pathologies. In the third result, we predicted a squat-to-stand motion using a custom }\textit{\DIFadd{MocoStudy}}\DIFadd{. We then solved the problem again while optimizing the stiffness of an assistive device at the knee to evaluate the effect of assistance on muscle activity. These three results illustrate the most common user interfaces provided by Moco and demonstrate that Moco can efficiently and accurately solve problems relevant to biomechanics researchers.

\DIFaddend \subsection*{Prescribing a walking motion to estimate muscle activity}

Moco can estimate muscle activity in walking, which allows studying muscle coordination in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{healthy }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normal }\DIFaddend and pathological gait. We used a model with \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{33 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{29 }\DIFaddend degrees of freedom and 80 lower-limb muscles\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Rajagopal:2016ek} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, generalized coordinate trajectories (obtained from an inverse kinematics solution and adjusted using the OpenSim Residual Reduction Algorithm), and ground reaction forces }\DIFaddend to simulate one gait cycle of walking at a self-selected speed of 1.24 m/s. The \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{scaled }\DIFdelend model and data are based on\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the supplementary material of~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Rajagopal:2016ek}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Rajagopal:2016ek}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
, where they are described in greater detail}\DIFaddend . We modeled activation dynamics in all muscles but only modeled tendon compliance in the gastrocnemii and soleus, where a rigid-tendon assumption is less \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{valid}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{appropriate}\DIFaddend ~\cite{Groote:2016dq}. We solved for muscle \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{activity }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{behavior }\DIFaddend using \textit{MocoInverse}, which prescribes kinematics exactly (see ``Tools for standard problems'' for details)\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, and compared the resulting muscle activations }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. The initial guess for all variables was the midpoint of the bounds on the variables. We compared the muscle activations produced by }\textit{\DIFadd{MocoInverse}} \DIFaddend to electromyography measurements (Fig~\ref{walking}; black lines and gray shading).

\textit{MocoInverse} produced activations that included some of the major features of the electromyography data, such as the timing of peak activity for the semitendinosus, biceps femoris short head, vastus lateralis, medial gastrocnemius, and soleus. Activity for the iliacus was much higher than measured in a separate data set~\cite{Perry:2010}\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{because other hip flexor muscles in the model (which have larger hip adduction moment arms) remained inactive to avoid counteracting the required hip abduction net joint moment}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{; this is likely because the passive hip flexion moment generated by the model during late stance~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Rajagopal:2016ek} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
is much lower than expected based on passive moments measured by load cells~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Whittington:2008jia}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend . With \textit{MocoInverse}, the difference between required net joint moments and muscle-generated net joint moments (termed ``reserve'' moments) were restricted to be no greater than 2.5 N-m across time and degrees of freedom, which is in accordance with established guidelines (reserve moments are below 5\% of peak net joint moments~\cite{Hicks:2015bo}). \textit{MocoInverse} solved this problem in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{2.8 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{3.5 }\DIFaddend minutes using a 3.6 GHz Intel Core i7 processor with 8 parallel threads\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{; this duration is similar to the amount of time required by the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. We compared the solution from ~}\textit{\DIFadd{MocoInverse}} \DIFadd{to those from the OpenSim Static Optimization and }\DIFaddend Computed Muscle Control~\cite{Thelen:2003bba} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{tool in OpenSim for solving prescribed motion problems as reported by Rajagopal and colleagues~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Rajagopal:2016ek}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{tools (S2 Fig). Muscle activity was similar between all three tools for all muscles shown except the medial gastrocnemius, soleus, and tibialis anterior; differences for these muscles were caused by differences in the algorithms, such as how tendon compliance was handled}\DIFaddend .

To demonstrate \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Moco's customizability}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{that Moco problems are customizable}\DIFaddend , we added a cost term to \textit{MocoInverse} to minimize knee joint loading \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(weight for squared controls term: 1.0; weight for joint loading term: 0.005)}\DIFaddend . With this additional cost, the average magnitude of the knee joint reaction force decreased from \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{1.8 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1.7 }\DIFaddend to 1.1 body weights. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The peak knee joint reaction force was 5.0 body weights with and without the additional cost; obtaining a peak value closer to those measured with in-vivo knee joint implants (1.8--3.0 body weights~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Fregly:2011ke}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
) may be possible by minimizing the deviation of muscle activity from electromyography data~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Kinney:2013}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
. }\DIFaddend As expected, the activity of muscles crossing the knee joint (vastus lateralis, biceps femoris short head, and medial gastrocnemius) decreased (Fig~\ref{walking}; blue lines). To compensate for the reduced medial gastrocnemius moment at the ankle, soleus activity increased, as seen in a previous simulation study~\cite{DeMers:2014}. Moco solved this problem in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{8.2 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{15 }\DIFaddend minutes.

\subsection*{Tracking a walking motion with \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{healthy }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normal }\DIFaddend and weakened muscles}

In addition to producing initial guesses for predictive optimizations, tracking problems (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{where motion tracking is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{in which a motion is tracked as }\DIFaddend part of the cost function rather than exactly prescribed) can be useful for studying how changes to a model affect its ability to reproduce a reference motion. Moco \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{provides }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{contains }\DIFaddend the \textit{MocoTrack} tool for constructing and solving tracking simulations. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{With this tool, the cost includes terms for motion tracking and control effort. }\DIFdelend We explored the effect of weakening different muscle groups in a lower extremity walking model on the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{model's }\DIFdelend ability to track \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{healthy }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normal }\DIFaddend walking data. As inputs to \textit{MocoTrack}, we used the same model and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{walking }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{kinematic }\DIFaddend data as for the \textit{MocoInverse} problem above\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, with one major addition: the model now included compliant foot-ground }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. Instead of prescribing ground reaction forces, we added compliant foot--ground }\DIFaddend contact force elements on both feet~\cite{Falisse:2019b}. We removed the torque actuators serving as ``reserve'' moments, which were only necessary for \textit{MocoInverse}, so that the lower limbs were entirely muscle-driven. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We added constraints so the model }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Unlike }\textit{\DIFadd{MocoInverse}}\DIFadd{, }\textit{\DIFadd{MocoTrack}} \DIFadd{does not prescribe model generalized coordinate values; therefore, we enforced the kinematic constraints in the model that dictate patellar motion based on the knee angle~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

. These kinematic constraints enabled realistic muscle moment arms about the knee without the need to model knee ligaments and cartilage. The cost included terms for motion tracking (weight: 0.11) and squared controls (weight: 0.16). We included a boundary constraint that ensured the model }\DIFaddend walked with the same average speed as in the reference data\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and the feet could not interpenetrate}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, and a path constraint that prevented the feet from interpenetrating}\DIFaddend .

We first solved the tracking problem using \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the model's normal (``healthy'') }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{normal }\DIFaddend muscle strengths (maximum isometric forces). \textit{MocoTrack} produced \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{a motion that tracked experimental kinematics (Fig 8, top) and }\DIFaddend ground reaction forces whose timing matched that of the sagittal plane experimental ground reaction forces (Fig~\ref{tracking}, left). Muscle activations for many major lower extremity muscles were qualitatively similar to electromyography data including gluteus maximus, biceps femoris short head, vastus lateralis, medial gastrocnemius, soleus, and tibialis anterior (Fig~\ref{tracking}, activations). Using the same computer as for the \textit{MocoInverse} problems, \textit{MocoTrack} solved this problem in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{104 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{130 }\DIFaddend minutes; this duration is shorter than that commonly seen in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{single-shooting }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{single shooting }\DIFaddend predictions~\cite{Ong:2019}, but is longer than what can be achieved when combining algorithmic differentiation with direct collocation~\cite{Falisse:2019b}.

\subsection*{Predicting and assisting a squat-to-stand motion}

To show that Moco can predict motions and optimize parameters of a model, we predicted a squat-to-stand motion that minimized a combination of \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{muscle }\DIFaddend effort, expressed as the sum of squared excitations \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(weight: 1.0)}\DIFaddend , and the duration of the motion \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(weight: 1.0)}\DIFaddend . The initial pose was prescribed to be squatting~\cite{Fregly:2015}, and the final pose was prescribed to be upright standing. No motion was tracked. The model contained a torso and a single leg \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{with }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{actuated by }\DIFaddend 9 muscles \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{obeying activation dynamicsand }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{with activation dynamics; 6 of these muscles had }\DIFaddend compliant tendon dynamics \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{; muscle strengths were based on those }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(hamstrings, rectus femoris, vasti, gastrocnemius, soleus, and tibialis anterior). Muscle strengths were taken }\DIFaddend from a previous study~\cite{Ong:2019} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. We used Moco's default initial guess , in which each variable's value is the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{and doubled to model both legs as one. We modeled foot--ground contact by fixing the foot of the model to the ground with a weld joint. The model contained the same kinematic constraints dictating patellar motion as described in the previous result. The initial guess for the kinematic variables was the }\DIFaddend midpoint of the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{variable's bounds }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{bounds on the variables; the initial guess for muscle excitations and activations was 0.05}\DIFaddend . The predicted motion and muscle activations are shown in Fig~\ref{squattostand} (black lines). As expected\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Yavuz:2017}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend , extensor muscles such as the gluteus maximus, hamstrings, and vasti exhibited \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the greatest }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{substantial }\DIFaddend activity.

Next, we added a torsional spring to the knee and solved for the optimal motion, muscle activations, and spring stiffness. The spring was in equilibrium when the knee was extended, as illustrated in Fig~\ref{squattostand}. We used the same cost as in the unassisted case; no motion was tracked. With the assistive device, the motion was achieved with lower muscle activity. The optimal spring stiffness was 90 N-m/rad.

Both predictions converged in 3 minutes. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Moco's }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The }\DIFaddend ability to rapidly predict motions and optimize device parameters makes \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{it }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Moco }\DIFaddend a valuable tool for designing assistive devices.

\DIFaddbegin \subsection*{\DIFadd{Summary of verification and validation}}

\DIFadd{For each of our results, we validated our simulated quantities against experimental electromyography, kinematics, and ground reaction forces as appropriate. To ensure our solutions were not sensitive to our choice of mesh, we performed a sensitivity analysis (S3 Fig). Our verification and validation shows that Moco is capable of producing meaningful results but does not guarantee that users will obtain meaningful results for their own applications. Researchers must validate the results they obtain with their own models, cost terms, constraints, and data by comparing their results to appropriate experimental data; we encourage researchers to follow previously published guidelines~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

\DIFaddend \section*{Availability and future directions}

OpenSim Moco is free to download for Windows and Mac on \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Moco's }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the Moco }\DIFaddend website (\\https://opensim.stanford.edu/moco) and SimTK (https://simtk.org/projects/opensim-moco).

The documentation for Moco \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is extensive}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{contains four main sections}\DIFaddend . The User Guide \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that }\DIFdelend explains how to use Moco and provides tips for posing a problem\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{.

The }\DIFaddend Application Programming Interface (API) Reference describes the classes and functions in the library\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, and the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. The }\DIFaddend Developer Guide explains our software design. We provide a two-page ``cheat sheet'' that demonstrates common commands. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{To use Moco effectively, users must be familiar with various topics not covered in the documentation, including optimal control theory and direct collocation~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Betts:2010}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
, numerical methods (e.g., finite differences) and optimization and associated pitfalls (e.g., local minima), multibody dynamics, Hill-type muscle models~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD

}

\DIFaddend Moco contains examples in MATLAB, Python, and C++ that range from predicting the optimal trajectory for a double pendulum to predicting 2-D muscle-driven walking (which solves in 30 minutes). The code that generated the results for this paper \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{are }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is }\DIFaddend available at https://github.com/stanfordnmbl/mocopaper.

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Moco and the direct collocation method have a number of limitations that should be considered when planning a simulation study. Moco currently lacks the ability to handle certain optimal control problems, such as those with multiple phases~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Falisse:2017} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
or unilateral kinematic constraints~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Patel:2019}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
. Bringing custom model components (e.g., a fatigable muscle) into Moco requires knowledge of C++ and the OpenSim software architecture; future versions of the software should allow users to implement custom model components in MATLAB or Python. The performance and ease of use of the direct collocation solvers in Moco could be improved. Computing the nonlinear program derivatives with algorithmic differentiation instead of finite differences would vastly improve the speed of Moco~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Falisse:2019a}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
. Supporting mesh refinement would allow the solver to increase the number of mesh intervals in time ranges with fast dynamics, thereby improving accuracy~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Betts:2010}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
. Lastly, the direct collocation method itself is not well-suited to simulations that are interactive (e.g., users perturbing the model) or include randomness (e.g., uneven terrain); such problems are better suited to single shooting~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Ong:2019} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
or reinforcement learning approaches~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{Kidzinski:2019}}\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD

}

\DIFaddend Going forward, we will focus on applying Moco to high-impact \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{scientific questions in biomechanics. Moco brings biomechanists closer than ever before to predicting outcomes of }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{topics in biomechanics, including }\DIFaddend orthopedic surgeries and rehabilitation strategies such as \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{tendon surgeries and }\DIFdelend muscle strength training. Predictions of movement typically employ generic models because large-scale subject-specific simulations are difficult to build. Moco permits researchers to easily build and share subject-specific studies that could discern which individuals may benefit from an intervention. Using Moco with \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{data from }\DIFaddend inertial measurement units~\cite{Dorschky:2019} or \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{video data }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{videos processed with computer vision~\mbox{%DIFAUXCMD
\cite{OpenPose:2019} }\hspace{0pt}%DIFAUXCMD
}\DIFaddend will allow researchers to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{analyze and predict }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{study }\DIFaddend muscle behavior for movements based on observations outside of the laboratory.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{We believe Moco 's community will be its strongest asset}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The Moco project benefits from an active community of researchers employing musculoskeletal simulation}\DIFaddend . We have \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{already begun building }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{engaged }\DIFaddend this community by hosting workshops \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{that have put Moco in the hands of over 100 researchers. We will grow this community through additional workshops at }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{on Moco at international }\DIFaddend conferences, at Stanford University, and online\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. We will continue to engage this community through additional workshops }\DIFaddend and by helping others to contribute documentation, examples, teaching materials, and code.

We designed Moco to be easy to use, customizable, and extensible. We verified the software and applied it to multiple musculoskeletal problems. Moco handles models with kinematic constraints, muscle activation dynamics, compliant tendons, and compliant contact, and can minimize a combination of complex costs such as marker tracking and joint reaction loads. Given this foundation, we expect Moco to accelerate research by reducing the time spent wrestling with simulation tools and enabling our field to tackle more ambitious problems.
